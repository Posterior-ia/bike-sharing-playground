    "Note that `level` and `s` are updated recursively while we collect the expected value at each time step. NumPyro uses [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) in the backend to JIT compile many critical parts of the NUTS algorithm, including the verlet integrator and the tree building process. However, doing so using Python's `for` loop in the model will result in a long compilation time for the model, so we use `scan` - which is a wrapper of [lax.scan](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html#jax.lax.scan) with supports for NumPyro primitives and handlers. A detailed explanation for using this utility can be found in [NumPyro documentation](http://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/primitives.html#scan).
